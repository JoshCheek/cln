Command Line Notes
==================

Lots of times I hear one-off comments about things that I want to remember. But I don't write them down and don't remember them :(

Soooooo, I made a quick list of notes that I wanted to be able to recall. But when Apple wiped my hd, I lost all of that. So this time
it's under source control, and done using [I Like Mustaches](https://github.com/JoshCheek/i_like_mustaches) to present and search through them.
